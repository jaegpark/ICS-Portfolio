        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <br><hr><br>
        From what you've been taught in Java, there are many ways that one could make a list of items. But what if I needed to find
        a specific item in the list? In the future, you will most likely encounter such scenarios. In this tutorial, I am going to
        teach you two forms of searching: binary and sequential search.

      <h3>Sequential Search</h3>
      <br><hr><br>
      <p>
        Sequential search, as complex as it may sound, is actually probably one of the first ways of searching you will think of.
        Sequential search is when you loop through each element of the list, left to right or right to left, to see if the current
        element is equal to the one we are looking for.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Lets look at an example of two boolean methods that will perform sequential search. They will be passed in an int array to look through, as well
        as a target value it searches for. They will return true if a matching number has been found. Else, they will return false.
        Note that the only difference between these two methods is that one will use a foreach loop to perform the search, while the other
        will use a regular array traversal.
        <br>
        <pre>
          <code>
            public class Sequentialsearchdemo{

              // using a foreach loop
              public boolean sequentialSearch1(int [] array, int target){
                for(int element : array){
                  if (element == target){
                    return true;
                  }
                }
                return false;
              }

              // using a regular for loop
              public boolean sequentialSearch2(int [] array, int target){
                for(int i = 0; i< array.length; i++){
                  if (array[i] == target){
                    return true;
                  }
                }
                return false;
              }

              // using a while loop
              public boolean sequentialSearch3(int [] array, int target){
                int index = 0;
                while(index < array.length){
                  if (array[index]==target){
                    return true;
                  }
                  index++;
                }
                return false;
              }

              // driver method
              public static void main (String [] args){
                int [] testList1 = {1,2,3,4,5};
                int [] testList2 = {11, 12, 13, 14, 511};
                int [] testList3 = {-121,-122,100, -123, 4};
                System.out.println(binarySearch1(testList1, 4));    // will output true since 4 is an element inside testList1.
                System.out.println(binarySearch2(testList2, 100));  // will output false since 100 is not an element in testList2.
                System.out.println(binarySearch3(testList3, -123)); // will output true since -123 is an element inside testList3.
              }
            }

        It is important to note that we are using the == comparator here, instead of the .equals() method. This is because we were dealing
        with relatively simple primitive values. Here is a more generic method demonstration, that goes through a list of Comparable objects.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            public class Genericsequentialdemo{

              public boolean genericSequentialSort(Comparable [] items, Comparable target){
                for(Comparable currElement : items){
                  if (target.equals(currElement)) return true;
                }
                return false;
              }

              public static void main(String [] args){
                Comparable [] stringArray = {"hi", "my", "name", "is", "jae"};
                Comparable [] integerList = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};

                System.out.println(genericSequentialSort(stringArray, "jae"));  // will output true since "jae" is an element.
                System.out.println(genericSequentialSort(integerList, 9));      // will output false since 9 is not an element.
              }
            }

        See? Not that hard! Now, as you can tell, this can be very inefficient when going through large sets of data. Generally,
        you would use a sequential search when you are dealing with randomized/non-sorted lists. If the list is sorted, there are other
        more efficient ways of dealing with them. Let's take a look.

      <h3>Binary Search</h3>
      <br><hr><br>
      <p>
        Binary search, only works on lists that are sorted in some decreasing or increasing order. For the sake of demonstration, I
        will only be talking about increasing ordered lists.
        Essentially, a binary serach looks at the element in the middle of the list, and checks whether this is the element we are looking for. If not, it
        decides whether the value we are looking for exists in right-half (is a larger value), or the left-half (is a smaller value).
        After determining this, it redirects our attention to the half we have determined, and checks the middle element of that smaller list.
        This "checking middle, process middle" step repeats in an iterative manner, until the target has been found.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Lets look at an iterative example code below, where we will look for the index of a target int inside an array of ints:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            public class BinarySearchDemo{

              // This method returns the index of the target if it is found in array. Else, it returns -1.
              public int binarySearchIterative(int [] array, int target){
                int leftIndex = 0, rightIndex = array.length-1;
                while(leftIndex <= rightIndex){
                  int middleIndex = leftIndex + (rightIndex-1)/2;

                  if (array[middleIndex]==target) return middleIndex;

                  if (array[middleIndex]< target) leftIndex = middleIndex+1;
                  else rightIndex = middleIndex-1;
                }
                return -1;
              }

              public static void main(String [] args){
                int [] testArray = {1,2,3,4,10,20,100};
                System.out.println("The index of the element " + 2 + " is at " + binarySearchIterative(testArray, 2));
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        As you can tell, this method of traversing and searching through a list is much more efficient, since it doesn't actually check
        every element like a sequential search. The key takeaway here is that binary search is very effient at searching for elements
        inside large, sorted lists.

        Overall, these one of these two ways of seraching are very applicable in most situations.
