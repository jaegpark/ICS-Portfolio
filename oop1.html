    <h2>OOP - Object Oriented Programming</h2>
    <br><hr><br><br>
    <h3>What is OOP in Java?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
      OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is a style of programming that involves the manipulation of Objects and their attributes/behaviours. There
      are 4 fundamental principles within OOP: inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism. In this tutorial, I will guide you through
      these 4 principles, with code examples in between. But to start, it is important to get the fundamental concepts such as classes, objects, and
      methods properly taught. Let's begin.
    </p>

      <h3>Objects and Classes</h3>
      <br>
      <h4><u>What are they?</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        To get an understanding of objects in Java, let's first see what an object is in real life. Think of some real word objects.
        Cats, dogs, cars, humans, pencils... so many more! If we think about it, all of these objects have a state and behaviour.
        We can then think of objects in Java similarly. These objects in Java store their states in variable fields, and store their
        behaviours into blocks of codes called methods.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        For example, a cat object would have states such as a name, breed, and colour, and would have
        behaviours such as meowing, eating, and drinking. Such objects, in Java, come from instances of Classes...
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Wait, what is a class?
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Classes in Java are like blueprints/templates on how to build an Object. It would define the basic attributes that each instance of itself would contain.
        For example, a Cat class would have attributes/variables of breed, colour, and name, and have behaviours/methods of meowing, eating, and drinking.
        The following would be a template of a Cat class.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          <code>
            public class Cat{   // note that it is a convention to capitalize names of classes, and camel-case all names.
              String name;
              String colour;
              String breed;

              void meow(){
                // code for meow method here
              }

              void eat(){
                // code for eat method here
              }

              void drink(){
                // code for drink method here
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><u>Variables Inside Classes</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        We just learned that the states of objects are stored inside variables.
        In Java classes, there are three types of variables that can be found:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Local variables</b> : these are variables which are declared inside a method. They are called
        local, since the data/memory allocated for this variable will be removed from the stack (a place in memory),
        once the method has finished execution.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Instance variables</b> : these are variables which are declared within a class, but not within a method.
        These are intialized during class instantiation, or in other words, when an instance of the class is made.
        These variables are also sometimes called global variables, since they are accessible by any method inside
        the same class.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Class/static variables</b> : these are variables declared within a class, outside any method, with the "static"
        keyword. These variables, unlike instance variables, do not require an object of the class to be made before using it.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- methods -->
    <article>
      <h3>Methods</h3>
      <br><hr><br>
      <h4><u>What are they?</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        In Java, a method is a block of code which is only run when the method is called. In other programming languages,
        methods can sometimes be called functions or procedures. Often times, methods are designed to do specific tasks within a
        program. Together with other methods, they allow the program to run properly.
        Additionally, in Java, methods can be given parameters (data passed into a method) to manipulate. We will touch on this later.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        It is important to note that in Java, methods cannot be written by themselves. They MUST be written inside a class.
        Methods are defined by a name, followed by a set of parantheses().
        Although Java brings in default libraries which contain a multitude of classes and their methods, often times, programmers
        program their own methods, to do exactly what they want.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        For example, let's look at a method header of a method called "calculate" inside the class Demo.
        <br><br>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          <code>
            public class Demo{
              void calculate(){
                // code for method goes here.
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        You may have noticed the "void" keyword there in front of the method name. Don't worry, all that means for now
        is that the method has no return value.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><u>Parameters</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        It was mentioned before that data could be passed into a method through "parameters."
        Essentially, a parameter is a piece of information that is passed into a method. These parameters are
        declared inside the parantheses. There is no limit to the number of parameters you can have
        inside a method. Just make sure that they are all separated with commas.
        It is advised though to minimize the number of parameters, for the sake of program
        clarity. Remember, a method call will be invalid unless all parameter values have been passed in, IN CHRONOLOGICAL
        ORDER.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Let's look at this example here. In this method called "add", we will have two int parameters.
        The method will output the value of the sum of these two numbers.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          <code>
            public class Demo1{
              public static void add(int firstNumber, int secondNumber){
                System.out.println(firstNumber+secondNumber);
              }

              public static void main(Stirng[] args){
                add(5, 2);  // will call the add method with the firstNumber parameter value of 5, and secondNumber value of 2.
                            // this will print the value of 7.
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><u>Passing Into Methods</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        In Java, there are two ways to pass parameters into a method: pass by value and pass by reference.
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Pass by value: pass by value is when the method parameter values are copied to another variable. This new variable is then passed and
          manipuated on.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pass by reference: this is when a reference pointer is passed into the method.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        Let's take a look at an example:
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><u>Return Types</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        In the examples you've seen so far, you have seen the keyword "void" be used multiple times. What does that
        really mean though? In Java, methods have certain return types. The void keyword indicates that the method
        does not actually return anything. To have a method return a value, whether it be an object or primitive data,
        all you need to do is add the name of the datatype's name in the method header.
        Remember, all return-type methods MUST contain the keyword "return" inside the method. This return statement
        must be reachable, regardless of the code inside the method.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Note: a return method does not actually output anything! To print something returned by a return method,
        a print statement is often called to the return value of the method.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Let's look at this example: this is similar code to the Demo1 class. The method add takes in two ints to add,
        and returns the value of their sum.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          <code>
            public class Demo2{
              public static int add(int firstNumber, int secondNumber){
                return (firstNumber+secondNumber);
              }

              public static void main(String [] args){
                System.out.println(add(2, 3));
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <br>
      <!-- mutator/accessor methods -->
      <h4><u>Mutator/Accessor Methods</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        In classes, special methods are used that are usually named getSOMETHING() and setSOMETHING().
        These methods are called getters/setters, or accessor/mutator methods. These, in convention,
        are used to return/change the values of a class' attributes. These attributes are usually unable
        to be directly accessed by outer classes. This will be explained further under encapsulation.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Let's look at an example:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          <code>
            public class Demo3{
              String name;

              public void setName(String n){
                name = n;           // this sets the Demo3 classes name attribute to a new String value passed in as a parameter
              }

              public String getName(){
                return name;        // this method returns the value of the name attribute
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <br>
      <!--constructors -->
      <h4><u>Constructors</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        Constructors are special methods inside classes, which help with the instantiation of an object
        of its class. They are declared without a specified return type, and can have parameters passed in. They
        must be named after their Class name, and there can be many constructors inside a class, as long as
        they have different parameter values. This concept of having multiple methods named the same thing is
        called "overloading" methods.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Often, constructors have passed in parameters that help set the values of the attributes/states of the Object.
        Let's take a look at an example of a few constructors.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          <code>
            public class Student{
              private String name;
              private long studentNumber;
              private int lockerNumber;

              public Student(){   // this is the default constructor - it has no arguments/parameters passed in.
                    // initially, if this constructor is used, all of the instance's/object's attributes are pointed to null.
              }

              public Student(String studentName, long studentNum){  // this constructor takes in two attribute fields
                name = studentName;
                studentNumber = studentNum;
              }

              public Student(String studentName, long studentNum, int locker){  // this constructor takes in all attribute fields
                name = studentName;
                studentNumber = studentNum;
                lockerNumber = locker;
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        It is important to note that Java, by default, will create a default no argument constructor in case it was
        not made in the class already. This is done to avoid compiling errors.
      </p>

    <!--encapsulation-->
    <article>
      <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
      <br><hr><br>
      <h4><u>What is it?</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        In Java, there are keywords that can specify "visibility/accessibility" of something. When declaring a class, you may have
        noticed that we include the keyword "public." In Java, this means that the class is accessible by other classes in the same
        file location, which may want to use it to create objects. Think of encapsulation as a shield which controls what code from
        outside the class can access the data inside it.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        For common convention, it is often the case where instance variables are not accessable publicly/
        by outside the class. Instead, these are private fields, and are accessed using public methods written
        in the same class. You saw these earlier: the mutator/accessor methods.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The reason for keeping fields private is to avoid unwanted external code from disrupting their values.
        However, note that there are other cases where other levels of encapsulation are desired. In Java, there
        are three different levels of encapsuation:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
       They are achieved thorugh keywords:
       <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>public: this indicates that it is accessable from anywhere within the same local file.</li>
          <li>private: this indicates that it is only accessable within the class itself. </li>
          <li>protected: this indicates that it is only accessable within the same class heirarchy.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Let's look at an example of fully encapsulating a class:
      </p>
      <br>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        <code>
          public class Person{
            private String name;        // private fields: they cannot be accessed directly from outside this class
            private int age;            // Instead, they will need to use the public helper methods to access and change their values.

            public int getAge(){      // public accessor method for age field
              return age;
            }
            public String getName(){  // public accessor method for name field
              return name;
            }
            public void setAge(int newAge){ // public mutator method for age field
              age = newAge;
            }
            public void setName(String newName){  // public mutator method for name field
              name = newName;
            }
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <br>
      <p>
        This allows the methods, getAge(), getName(), setAge(), and setName() to be used in
        other classes in the same file. The instance variables name and age will not be
        able to be directly used in outer classes. The only way of modifying these values of the
        object would be to use these mutator methods.
      </p>
      <br><br>
    </article>

    <!--inheritance-->
    <article>
      <h3>Inheritance</h3>
      <br><hr><br>
      <p>
        In Java, a class can have a direct relationship with another class, by extending it. Using the extends keyword,
        a class can extend another class, inheriting all of its attributes and behaviours (its varaibles and methods).
        This is what we call inheritance. This is useful when creating many classes that will interact with each other in
        a full program. Let's look at an example below:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Consider the following classes: Cat, Dog, and Pet
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          <code>
            public class Cat{     // the Cat class
              private String name;
              private String breed;

              public Cat(String n, String b){   // two parameter constructor
                name = n;
                breed = b;
              }

              // other methods
              public void feed(){
                // code not shown
              }
              public void meow(){
                // code not shown
              }
            }

            public class Dog{     // the Dog class
              private String name;
              private String breed;

              public Dog(String s, String b){   // two parameter constructor
                name = s;
                breed = b;
              }

              // other methods
              public void feed(){
                // code not shown
              }
              public void bark(){
                // code not shown
              }
            }

            public class Pet{     // the Pet class
              private String name;
              private String breed;

              public void feed(){
                // code not shown
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        You see how Cat and Dog both contain <i>common</i> elements, that are in every Pet class?
        They all share the same fields (name, breed), and all have void methods (feed()) that feed the pet.
        To simplify this in Java, we can consider Cat and Dog "subclasses" of the Pet "superclass."
        You can often tell if something is a subclass of another thing, if there is a "is-a" relationship.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        For example:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>a Cat is-a Pet. Therefore, Cat is a subclass of Pet.</li>
          <li>a Dog is-a Pet. Therefore, Dog is a subclass of Pet.</li>
          <li>a Pet is-a Dog? No! Not all pets are dogs. This is how you know that Pet is not a subclass of Dog.</li>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Using this new knowledge of subclasses and superclasses, we can make the Dog and Cat class inherit the
        data from the Pet superclass. This is what the simplified version would look like below:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          <code>
            public class Cat extends Pet{           // extends the Pet class, so Cat is a subclass of Pet
              public Cat(String n, String b){       // two parameter constructor
                super(n, b);                    // Cat's constructor calls for the superclass' constructor.
              }                                 // In this case, it is Pet's constructor
              public void meow(){
                // code not shown
              }
            }

            public class Dog extends Pet{           // extends the Pet class, so Dog is a subclass of Pet
              public Dog(String n, String b){       // the contructor follows similar structure to the Cat constructor
                super(n, b);
              }
              public void bark(){
                // code not shown
              }
            }

            public class Pet{       // superclass code
              private String name;
              private String breed;
              public Pet(String petName, String petBreed){          // superclass constructor
                name = petName;
                breed = petBreed;
              }
              public void feed(){
                // code not shown
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <br>
        Here, we do not need to have the feed() method inside each subclass, since the subclasses will inherit the method from
        the superclass. This means, that in a client program, this:
        <br>
        <pre>
          <code>
            Dog dog1 = new Dog("Jeff", "Golden Retriever");
            dog1.feed();
          </code>
        </pre>
        will run without error. To find the feed() method, Java, during runtime, will go through the object's class' heirarchy to
        look for the first method found with the same name. This is explained in more detail later on in polymorphism.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Note: a subclass can also be a superclass to another subclass. There is no limit on the length of this inheritance/heirarchy tree.
        Just remember that the class at the bottom of this inheritance will inherit EVERYTHING.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><u>super</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        In Java, <code class="segment">super</code> is a reserved keyword, that is often used to refer the instance variable of the immediate superclass. This
        means it can act as an identifier when calling the superclass' methods.
        As well, super() is often used in place of the immediate parent class' constructor. The corresponding constructor will depend
        on the parameters given to super().

      <h3>Abstraction</h3>
      <br><hr><br>
      <h4><u>What is it?</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        In Java, there is a keyword "abstract" which can be applied to methods, variables, and even entire classes.
        The abstract keyword indicates that you are dealing with an <i> idea </i>, rather than an actual <i>event.</i>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        When speaking about OOP, classes, methods, and variables are usually abstracted to hide the code implementation from
        the user. In OOP, there are two ways you can achieve abstraction: through abstract classes or through an interface.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><u>Abstract Classes</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        An abstract class can easily be identified if it contains the keyword "abstract" in the class declaration. In Java,
        abstract classes will have the following properties:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Abstract classes will OR will not contain abstract methods. As a side note, abstract methods in abstract classes
        are written without a code body block. For example: (public void doSomething();), would be how the method actually looks like
        inside an abstract class.</li>
        <li>Abstract classes cannot be instantiated by itself, to create objects. </li>
        <li>To use an abstract class, it must be inherited by another non-abstract class, which will need to implement its methods.</li>
        <li>If an abstract class is extended, all of its abstract methods must be implemented.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h4><u>Interfaces</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        In Java, another way to achieve abstraction is by using interfaces. Interfaces are essentially FULL abstract classes.
        All of its variables and methods are by default, abstract. Here are the key takeaways:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Methods inside interfaces are all abstract, and by default public.</li>
        <li>Variables in interfaces are public, static, and final. </li>
        <li>Interfaces cannot be instantiated by itself, to create objects. </li>
        <li>Interfaces cannot contain contructors.</li>
        <li>To use an interface, it must be implemented inside another class (using the keyword "implements"), which will need to implement all of its methods.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        <center>To outline this better, here is a a chart:</center>
        <br>
        <center><img src="chart.PNG" alt="Chart of similarities and differences"></center>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Let's look at an example of an interface being implemented:
      <br>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          <code>
            public interface Pet{
              public void makeNoise();      // the code is not actually written
              public void eat();            // for inteface methods
            }

            public class Dog implements Pet{
              public void makeNoise(){              // implements their own code for their own method
                System.out.println("Woof");
              }
            }

            public class Driver{
              public static void main(String [] args){
                Dog newDog = new Dog();   // default Dog object created
                newDog.makeNoise();
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <br><br>
    </article>

    <!-- polymorphism -->
    <article>
      <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
      <br><hr><br>
      <h4><u>What is it?</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        When you learned about inheritance, you may have realized in the shown example that you could call an instance of Dog, a Pet.
        Similarly, you could call an instance of Cat, a Pet. It is this ability for objects to take on many forms/names, which we call polymorphism.
        In Java, there are two times where we can see polymorphism: in compile time, and run time.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><u>Run Time Polymorphism</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        Run time polymorphism, or otherwise called dynamic binding, or overriding, is when the call for something in Java is NOT
        done through the compiler. This can be achieved by having the same method header in a class and a subclass.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        When using methods of a polymorphic class, Java will take the first method it can find in runtime in its class hierarchy. Let's
        look at an example below:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          <code>
            public class Toy{
              public void makeNoise(){                        // the makeNoise() method in the Toy class
                System.out.println("The toy made a noise!");
              }
            }

            public class Racecar extends Toy{
              public void makeNoise(){                        // the overriden makeNoise() method in the Racecar class
                System.out.println("The car went vroom!");
              }
            }

            public class PoliceCar extends Toy{
              public void makeNoise(){                        // the overriden makeNoise() method in the PoliceCar class
                System.out.println("The police car went bee-woo-bee-woo!");
              }
            }

            public class Driver1{
              public static void main(String [] args){
                Toy toy1 = new Toy();
                Toy toy2 = new Racecar();         // upcasted automatically
                Toy toy3 = new PoliceCar();       // upcasted automatically

                toy1.makeNoise();     // will use the makeNoise() method in the Toy class
                toy2.makeNoise();     // will use the makeNoise() method in the Racecar class
                toy3.makeNoise();     // will use the makeNoise() method in the PoliceCar class
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p>
          It turns out that the output for this code is:
          <br><br>
          The toy made a noise!
          <br>
          The car went vroom!
          <br>
          The police car went bee-woo-bee-woo!
        </p>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In conclusion, we can say that the action the makeNoise() method performed was based on the type of object
        it was called on. NOT the type of object reference.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><u>Compile Time Polymorphism</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        In compile-time, the call to whatever is being invoked in Java will be resolved by the compiler. Other definitions for
        compile time polymorphsm is overloading, and static binding. This is achieved by overloading methods in Java.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Here is an example of overloading methods. Overloaded methods have the same method signature, but have different parameter passes:
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          <code>
            <!-- TODO: comment -->
            public class CompileTimeDemo{

              public static void doSomething(){
                System.out.println("did something");
              }

              public static void doSomething(int n){
                System.out.println("did something with "+ n);
              }

              public static void doSomething(String s){
                System.out.println("did something with the String "+s);
              }

              public static void main(String [] args){
                doSomething();
                doSomething(4);
                doSomething("hello");
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <br>
        When the main method executes, the compiler will find the correct method call and resolve it based on the given parameters.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4><u>Upcasting and Downcasting</u></h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        Just like casting primitive datatypes when doing operations, Java can upcast/downcast objects when they are part of the same class
        hierarchy.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Upcasting is casting something to a supertype, or the type of the superclass. This type of casting is always allowed without causing an error, and is
        automatic in Java.
        This is because of the polymorphic properties of the subclass. The subclass of a superclass can always take on the reference label of the superclass.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Downcasting is casting a supertype down to its subtype. Unlike upcasting, this action is not always allowed, and often needs a type check.
        If the downcast was unsuccesful, a ClassCastException can be thrown. To avoid this, the instanceOf operator is often used to check if the
        cast conversion is possible.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        To use a method from the superclass, you can simply use the super.method() syntax, or do an upcast
        To use a method from the subclass, a downcast must be performed, using the instanceOf operator.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Let's take a look at the code example below:
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          <code>
            <!-- TODO: comment -->
            public class Person{
              public void saySomething(){
                System.out.println("This is from the Person class");
              }
            }

            public class Student extends Person{
              public void saySomething(){
                System.out.println("This is from the Student class");
              }

              public void saySomethingAgain(){
                System.out.println("This is from the second method in Student class");
              }
            }

            public class PeopleTester{
              public static void main(String [] args){

                Student upStudent = new Student();
                Person studentPerson = (Person) upStudent;  // explicitly done. However, Person studentPerson = upStudent;
                                                            // would have automatically upcasted.

                // valid downcasting
                Person person = new Student();    // person's runtime type is Student
                Student studentPerson = (Student) person; /

                // illegal downcasting
                Person person2 = new Person();  // person2's runtime type is a Person.
                Student failedStudent = (Student) person2;  // The Person class does not have a "is-a" relationship with the Student class.
                                                            // a Person is not always a Student.

                // when performing a method from the subclass
                Person p1 = somePerson(); // somePerson() returns a subclass of Person.
                if (p1 instanceof Student) {
                    Student newStudent = (Student) p1;
                }
              }
            }

        When describing class relationships in Java, there is a very useful diagram to use, called a class hierarchy tree.
        In hierarchy trees, classes are surrounded by rectangles, and have arrows demonstrating their relationships with each other.
