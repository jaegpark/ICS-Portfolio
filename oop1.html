    <h2>OOP - Object Oriented Programming</h2>
    <br><hr><br><br>
    <article>
      <h3>What is OOP in Java?</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is a style of programming that involves the manipulation of Objects and their attributes/behaviours.
        This style of programming was based on the real life world. This makes Java a very convinient programing language to use for many applications.
      </p>
      <br><hr><br><br>
      <h3>Objects and Classes</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Objects in Java have unique states/attributes and behaviours. For example, a cat object would have states/attributes such as a name, breed, and colour, and would have
        behaviours such as meowing, eating, and drinking. Such objects, in Java, come from instances of Classes...
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        So what is a class?
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Classes in Java are like blueprints/templates on how to build an Object. It would define the basic attributes that each instance of itself would contain.
        For example, a Cat class would have attributes/instance variables of breed, colour, and name, and have behaviours/methods of meowing, eating, and drinking.
        The following would be a template of a Cat class.
      </p>
      <br>
      <pre>
        <code>
        public class Cat{
          String name;
          String colour;
          String breed;

          void meow(){
            // code for meow method here
          }

          void eat(){
            // code for eat method here
          }

          void drink(){
            // code for drink method here
          }
        }
        </code>
      </pre>

    <!-- methods -->
    <article>
      <h3>Methods</h3>
      <br><hr><br>
      <h4>What are they?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        In Java, a method is a block of code which is only run when the method is called. In other languages/words,
        methods can sometimes be called functions. Often times, methods are designed to do specific tasks within a
        program. Together with other methods, they allow the program to run properly.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        As well, in Java, methods can be given parameters (data passed into a method). We will touch on this later.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        It is important to note that in Java, methods cannot be written by themselves. They MUST be written inside a class.
        Methods are defined by a name, followed by a set of parantheses().
        Although Java brings in default libraries which contain a multitude of classes and their methods, often times, programmers
        program their own methods, to do exactly what they want.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        For example, let's look at a creation of a method called "calculate" inside the class Demo.
        <pre>
          <code>
            public class Demo{
              void calculate(){
                // code for method goes here.
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        You may have noticed the "void" keyword there in front of the method name. Don't worry, all that means for now
        is that the method has no return value.
        Additionally, just keep in mind that the keyword static means that the method belongs to this class. More about
        these keywords will be touched upon later.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Parameters</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        It was mentioned before under Methods, that data could be passed into a method through parameters.
        Essentially, a parameter is a piece of information that is passed into an array. These parameters are
        declared inside the parantheses. There is no limit to the number of parameters you can have
        inside a method. Just make sure that they are all separated with commas.
        It is advised though to minimize the number of parameters, for the sake of program
        clarity. Remember, a method call will be invalid unless all parameter values have been passed in, IN CHRONOLOGICAL
        ORDER.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Let's look at this example here. In this method called "add", we will have two int parameters.
        The method will output the value of the sum of these two numbers.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <code>
        <pre>
          public class Demo1{
            static void add(int firstNumber, int secondNumber){
              System.out.println(firstNumber+secondNumber);
            }

            public static void main(Stirng[] args){
              add(5, 2);  // will call the add method with the firstNumber parameter value of 5, and secondNumber value of 2.
                          // this will print the value of 7.
            }
          }
        </pre>
      </code>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Return Types</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        In the examples you've seen so far, you have seen the keyword "void" be used multiple times. What does that
        really mean though? In Java, methods have certain return types. The void keyword indicates that the method
        does not actually return anything. To have a method return a value, whether it be an Object or primitive data,
        all you need to do is add the name of the Object's class or the primitive data name in the method header.
        Remember, all return-type methods MUST contain the keyword "return" inside the method. This must be reachable,
        regardless of the code inside the method.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Note: a return method does not actually output anything! To print something returned by a return-method,
        a print statement is often called to the return value of the method.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Let's look at this example: this is similar code to the Demo1 class. The method add takes in two ints to add,
        and returns the value of their sum.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <code>
          <pre>
            public class Demo2{
              static int add(int firstNumber, int secondNumber){
                return (firstNumber+secondNumber);
              }

              public static void main(String [] args){
                System.out.println(add(2, 3));
              }
            }
          </pre>
        </code>
      </p>

    <article>
      <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        In Java, there are keywords that can specify "visibility/accessibility." When declaring a class, you may have
        noticed that we include the keyword "public." In Java, this means that the class is accessible by other classes,
        which may want to use its Objects. Think of it as a shield which prevents code from outside the class from
        accessing the data inside it.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        For common convention, it is often the case where instance variables are not accessable
        by outside the class. Instead, these fields are accessed using methods declared in the same class.
        These methods are often called mutator/accessor methods. We will discuss this later.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
       Keywords in Java include:
       <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>public: this indicates it is accessable from anywhere within the same local file.</li>
          <li>private this indicates that it is only accessable within the class. </li>
          <li>protected: this indicates that it is only accessable within the same class heirarchy.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Constructors</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Constructors are special methods inside classes, which help with the instantiation of an object
        of its class. They are declared without a specified return type, and can have parameters passed in.
