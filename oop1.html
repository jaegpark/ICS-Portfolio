    <h2>OOP - Object Oriented Programming</h2>

      <h3>What is OOP in Java?</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is a style of programming that involves the manipulation of Objects and their attributes/behaviours.
        This style of programming was based on the real life world. This makes Java a very convinient programing language to use for many applications.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Objects and Classes</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Objects in Java have unique states/attributes and behaviours. For example, a cat object would have states/attributes such as a name, breed, and colour, and would have
        behaviours such as meowing, eating, and drinking. Such objects, in Java, come from instances of Classes...
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        So what is a class?
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Classes in Java are like blueprints/templates on how to build an Object. It would define the basic attributes that each instance of itself would contain.
        For example, a Cat class would have attributes/instance variables of breed, colour, and name, and have behaviours/methods of meowing, eating, and drinking.
        The following would be a template of a Cat class.
      </p>
      <br>
      <pre>
        public class Cat{
          String name;
          String colour;
          String breed;

          void meow(){

          }

          void eat(){

          }

          void drink(){

          }
        }
      </pre>

      <h3>School and Things - A Short Example</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        This is an example that demonstrates different levels of explainations of Object Oriented Programming, using a story.
        This story is one where the TDSB must make a blueprint design for the future construction of their high schools.

        In this guide, you will find that sections are separated by yellow, and red blocks. These indicate their
        levels of resemblance to how an actual program would be written, where red is the actual code and
